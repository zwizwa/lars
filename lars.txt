So the basic ideas:

- Think of Rust as the implementation + scripting language
- Keep integration in sigrok in mind


This is a built off of the ideas of pyla, a Python + C++ logic
analyzer.  It worked fine, but still was clumsy in its aproach so I
started thinkig that Rust might be good as both a core implementation
language for the signal processors and the dataflow glue.

Meaning: is it really necessary to process events from multiple
sources at the same time?  This is about the only obviou reason to
_not_ use a task/process abstraction for handling communication
protocols.
