# la.rs - Logic Analyzer tools for Rust.

This is a spinoff of http://github.com/zwizwa/pyla


# Install

Use `cargo build` to compile just the library exposing reusable code.

This is probably most useful together with the `src/run_*.rs`
examples.  See `src/Makefile` for examples on how to use in practice.
This also includes build instructions for a Saleae Logic frontend
driver (C++).
